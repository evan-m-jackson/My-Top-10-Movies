# My-Top-10-Movies

I created this application that keeps track of the user's favorite movies. The movie list can be updated to add or remove entries on the list.  Also the ranking is automated based on the rating that the user gives each movie.  I used HTML, CSS and Python to create this app.  In Python, I also used Flask, Bootstrap, SQLAlchemy, and WTForms to help design the app and also create a database for the movie entries.
